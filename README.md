# Random Gif Generator 😎

This is a project I'm using to help me understand node, express, and api's a little better. It's a pretty simple project, with the goal to have a user generate a random gif, based on a tag they enter.

## TODO

- [x] Create routes for index and gif endpoint
- [x] Set up request to api for a random gif
- [x] Create index template
- [x] Add form to request tag from user
- [x] Style the index template
- [x] Add client side JS to display the random gif

## Future Ideas
  - Swap out handlebars for react
  - Spend some time coming up with a quality design
  - Make it responsive
