# Random Gif Generator 😎

This is a project I'm using to help me understand node, express, and api's a little better. It's a pretty simple project, with the goal to have a user generate a random gif, based on a tag they enter.

# TODO

- [ ] Create routes for index and gif endpoint
- [ ] Set up request to api for a random gif
- [ ] Create index template
- [ ] Add form to request tag fromuser
- [ ] Style the index template
- [ ] Add client side JS to display the random gif
